# Berr.io - Modularization Summary

## What was done:

The original monolithic `main.lua` file (1291 lines) has been separated into multiple modular files for better organization and maintainability:

### New Module Files:

1. **`config.lua`** - Configuration and constants
   - Colors definition
   - Keyboard layout
   - Button creation functions
   - Game state configurations

2. **`utils.lua`** - Utility functions
   - Screen dimension calculations
   - Responsive scaling functions
   - Grid dimension calculations
   - Button positioning utilities
   - Mouse input detection

3. **`ui.lua`** - User Interface drawing functions
   - Menu drawing
   - Instructions screen
   - Difficulty selection
   - Virtual keyboard rendering
   - Debug information display
   - Text wrapping utilities

4. **`gameLogic.lua`** - Game logic functions
   - Game initialization
   - Key input processing
   - Keyboard state management
   - Game state updates

5. **`gameDraw.lua`** - Game-specific drawing functions
   - Easy mode game rendering
   - Medium mode game rendering (2 grids)
   - Hard mode game rendering (3 grids)

### Updated `main.lua`:
- Now only contains 280 lines (down from 1291)
- Imports all modular components
- Handles LÖVE2D callbacks (load, update, draw, input)
- Manages global game state
- Coordinates between modules

### Benefits:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused or replaced independently
4. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
5. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

### Next Steps for Full Modularization:
1. Move asset loading to a separate module
2. Create a proper game state manager
3. Abstract the LÖVE2D dependencies for better testing
4. Add proper error handling and validation
5. Create a build/packaging system

The current modularization maintains full compatibility with the original functionality while providing a much cleaner and more maintainable codebase structure.
